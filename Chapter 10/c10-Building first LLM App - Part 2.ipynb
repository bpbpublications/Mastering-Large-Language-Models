People who work sincerely are the happiest.\" \\nFear of failure is a natural emotion and can act as an obstacle in achieving success. However, it needs to be controlled and not allowed to take over. The way to overcome the fear of failure is to understand that failure is an integral part of life and not an end to it. Knowing that each failure is an opportunity to learn another lesson and move ahead is useful. That is why it is highly important to stay focused and work hard despite the fear. Hard work with right attitude will eventually bring success and satisfaction. By following Chanakya\\'s wisdom, you will be able to break free from the fear and set yourself up for success.'"
